# Pascal Code Revival
Resurrecting a **TURBO PASCAL 5.5** program found as printout in an archive box in the attic.
The original disk with the source code seems to have got lost. So what I did is:
- scan the code from the matrix printer sheets
- upload the PDF to Google's Vertex AI for OCR
- manually edit the OCR output

### Update March 30, 2025
In the meantime, a backup of a floppy disc with the title "Pascal Programme Stand 1993"
has been found. From this disc, I uploaded the file 'hegira2.pas' which offers an interactive
user interface for converting AD dates to hijri dates and vice versa.
Unfortunately, it requires Turbo Pascal 6 to run.
