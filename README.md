# Pascal Code Revival
Resurrecting a **TURBO PASCAL 5.5** program found as printout in an archive box in the attic.
The original disk with the source code seems to have got lost. So what I did is:
- scan the code from the matrix printer sheets
- upload the PDF to Google's Vertex AI for OCR
- manually edit the OCR output
